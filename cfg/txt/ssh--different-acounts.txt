Use SSH Keys for Different Accounts: If you're using SSH for authentication, you can create separate SSH keys for each account and configure them in your SSH config file (~/.ssh/config):

Host github-work
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work

Host github-personal
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal

Then, clone repositories using the appropriate host alias (e.g., git@github-work:username/repo.git).
